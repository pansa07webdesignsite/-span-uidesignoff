 <article class="extra"><h2>What is the difference between Influenza? (Flu) and COVID-19?</h2>
 	<p class="o1">
        Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses. Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis. Flu and COVID-19 share many characteristics, but there are some key differences between the two.</p>
    <span class="italics">While more is learned every day, there is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and the virus that causes.</span>
