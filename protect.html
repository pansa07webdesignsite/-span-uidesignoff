 	<h2>Know how it spreads!</h2>
        <p class="p1">The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
        <ul class="list"><li>Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).</li>
        	             <li>Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks.</li>
        	             <li>These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.</li>
        	             <li>Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.</li><ul>
